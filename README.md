# hello-world
My first repository.  
Hi, my name is Peter Rasmussen.  I just completed my first year of a two-year Associates Degree Program in Software Development.
I am interested in growing my knowledge and getting more experience.  I would also like to help out a team that is building
some cool open-source projects.  I am an avid gamer, and even more avid golfer.  I would love to work on any projects that deal 
with either of those two subjects but they are not necessary.  I just really like problem solving and creating things.
